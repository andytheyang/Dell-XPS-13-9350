This is the compiled snapshots of the Intel Nightly branch.  

I've had great success with the WD15 and no other bugs (sofar).
The current nightlies have a mouse cursor bug. 

The June 13 2016 update seems to offer more stability.

Some of the bugs I've seen through using this branch is:
- Screen artifacts on external monitors
- Artifacts and jumping of mouse cursor.  Ghost trails.
- Peripherals not being hot plug/detected.
- Some DE having elements that flash when hovered by mouse.
