###Hello
This is a collection of current fixes and my pkgbuild.  I hope it helps someone.  If you like it, star this repo.  Thank you.

###Instructions
git clone https://github.com/frank604/Dell-XPS-13-9350/tree/master/linux-dell

###Notes
1. I've restructured my git to organize between different kernel versions.
2. Please remember to add in nvme into mkinitcpio modules for 4.4.x
3. Take a look at the pkgbuild.  It changes based on kernel and rc version
